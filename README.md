This large language model is primarily designed to assess the severity of mental health issues by analyzing text or speech inputs from users(speakers, writers, patients, etc.). The training dataset consists of diagnoses made by psychiatrists based on the text or speech from patients experiencing various degrees of mental health problems.

The model serves multiple purposes. For instance, it can assist doctors in diagnosing mental health conditions in patients/certain individuals, or facilitate self-diagnosis for individuals seeking to understand their own mental health, or analyze the psychological characteristics of characters in fictional narratives.

The performace of this model in the test dataset (30477 rows) is as follows: 'accuracy': 0.78, 'f1': 0.77.

This model is one part of my project on fine-tuning open-source LLMs to predict various human cognitive abilities (e.g., personality, attitude, mental status etc.).
